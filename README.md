This is my implementation of the [Flight Search project](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-flight-search) 
in the [Android Basics with Compose course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course). The project uses a SQLite DB (provided by the course)
of Airports (and an empty Favorites table). The project will utilize Jetpack Compose, Room (for data persistence), and DataStore.
